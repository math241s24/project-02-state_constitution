# project-02
 template for project 2

This is the repository for the State Constitution Analysis project. Our team members are Cassie Minicucci, Katie Riley, and Basil-Anne Stackpole. The repository contains a file called stateconsapp.R with our shinyapp, a file called statecons.qmd with all of our data in URL form and code, an index.qmd containing the project write-up, a quarto.yml for website function, an about.qmd with details about the project, a proposal.qmd containing the project proposal, and a presentation.qmd containing the project presentation. Since our data is pulled from URLs, it is more convenient to simply list them rather than have a data folder; they can be found at the top of the statecons.qmd file.
