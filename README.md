 template for project 2

This is the repository for the State Constitution Analysis project. Our team members are Cassie Minicucci, Katie Riley, and Basil-Anne Stackpole. The repository contains an index.qmd and a quarto.yml for website function, an about.qmd with details about the project, a proposal.qmd containing the project proposal, and a presentation.qmd containing the project presentation. It will eventually contain a folder called "data" containing all datasets used in the project once they are located, scraped, and tidied.
